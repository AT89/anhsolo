  I have tried and tested a few gadgets and clothing that I absolutely need to have with me while traveling. This is my gear, this is my equipment, this is what I upgraded to +10 and to have the perfect stats
  <p>My Motto is buy nice or buy twice. I have found that aiming for quality and buying things that would last me a lifetime is a more frugal strategy over the long term and better for the environment/less waste.

  <p>Amazing backpack with style and utility. Perfectly stores my laptop, anti theft compartment for important things. Secret compartment on the side. Front is a duffel that fits a whole bunch of things. Waterproof. This backpack is what I consider to be life-lasting</p>

  <p>The perfect carry-on bag. Because it is more compact than rollies, you will never get stopped to ask to have this checked in. It also survives the check in as well. Fits quite a bit and collapses for storage. It has a pretty well working hangar compartment for pants/shirts. Shoes compartments on the sides too. I love this bag</p>

  <p>Shirts are comfortable breathable, light on the maintenance and durable. Form fitting and stretchy for <strong>those</strong> days. I like the <a href="https://ministryofsupply.com/products/hybrid-button-down-light-blue-gingham">Hybrid Dress Shirts</a>. The shirts are pretty high tech too! </p>

  <p>The shirts are pretty good here but they need to be ironed, but otherwise they are great for heavier climates and durability. The light shortsleeve shirts are great here too. I really like the <a href="https://shop.outlier.nyc/shop/retail/slim-dungarees.html">Slim Dungarees</a> for my go to Pants. These are very durable, high tech and form-fitting. I have not found slim pants that feel and fit this great. I have not worn jeans in years because of these. These are waterproof and you can even put out a cigarette on them without any damage. Very tough.</p>

  <p> I really like the <a href="https://wolfandshepherd.com/collections/best-sellers-1/products/senna-wingtip?variant=6269869850663">Sienna Wingtips</a> and the <a href="https://wolfandshepherd.com/collections/boots/products/breakaway-boot?variant=6270714478631">Onyx Breakaway boots</a>. These actually feel like sneakers and the quality is very high.</p>

  <p> I used to be a sneakerhead and have a pretty solid collection but it all ended once I tried on the Ultraboosts. There's really no sneaker as comfortable as these. 
  <p> Not a fan of the new 19s, I rock the 3.0 and 4.0's in Triple Black.

  <p>Charges all my devices. This thing is simply amazing with the plugs already connected</p>
