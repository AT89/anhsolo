This is mostly a page for things that I have found to supremely help out traveling.

I discovered a company that will let you rent a car through an app and bluetooth and without personally talking to anyone. As of 2019 Feb, <strong>it's only available in UK, France and Belgium.</strong>
<br><br>
<li>This means lower cost on overhead (no staff, no key handover, all forms are digital), 
<li>Faster check-in and check-out
<li>24/7 customer support (they replied within 5min)
<li>The fleet of vehicles they have are luxury plus cars I rented a Mercedes A180 for about 48-58euros a day. For me it was great because the other automatic option from Hertz was 69euros for a Ford Focus..
<li>Using the phone camera and app, you can do the damage report on check-in and check-out
<li>Super painless to change booking
<br><br>
<p>Sign up to Virtuo, then use the code <strong>spupmde</strong> to get â‚¬30 credit off your first rental.

<p>Also you can drive as fast as you want in Belgium on the left lane in the highway :)

<li>Man this card is so amazing. 
<li>3x pts on resturaunts and 3x on flights.
<li>$300 travel credit (works on uber). this effectively makes the annual fee only $100
<li>No international transaction fee
<li>Using the Chase Ultimate reward pts is easy within their site, for reference its 68k pts to book a roundtrip to Japan, 60k for Amsterdam (they have some multiplier on pts for travel).
<li>Priority Pass for airport lounges (free food, water)

<p>I found Visa way more widely acceptable than AMEX
