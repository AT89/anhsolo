First time in Montanna, this was a brief trip (and a short post) but Glacier National Park was a great experience and being able to see it and be there is definitely worth it for a post on it's own.

Glacier National Park is pretty close to Canada, highly suggest to visit it and camp here. The water was so clear because its literally from the Glaciers in the north. The glacier air was refreshing. The people here were super nice too
