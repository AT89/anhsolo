This trip was straight after New Zealand. First time in Australia and I was pretty excited for this. Only a few blocks from main parts of Sydney is an Asian town with amazing amazing Asian food such as: Curry Rice, Ramen, Sushi, misc chinese food. It was somewhat of a surprise for me to see so much Asian influence in Sydney. The most awesome part was that around this time was the annual light festival for Sydney. This means that one of the 7 Wonders of the World, the Sydney Opera House is fully illuminated in moving projections for all to see. There were about 30 different animated projections that cycled through every 15 seconds or so. I did not have a Pixel 2 at the time so no night sight :( but I seemed to muster some decent pictures from my Pixel.
